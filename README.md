Machine Learning Project Transactional Data -> Exploratory Data Analysis In Python: 
# Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Online Casino Player Transactions

## Overview
This project is the first in a three-part series that explores transactional data of online casino players using essential Python libraries: `pandas`, `sklearn`, and `seaborn`. The focus is on data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA), utilizing various techniques such as merging DataFrames, pivoting tables, aggregating data, and visualizing insights with charts and heatmaps.

## Features
- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Import and preprocess transactional data.
- **Data Wrangling**: Reindexing, grouping, and transforming datasets using `pandas`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing distributions with histograms and density plots.
  - Identifying patterns with bar charts and heatmaps.
  - Creating a Sankey diagram for customer lifetime analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Applying multiple functions to DataFrame columns.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for effective data presentation.
- **Project Ideas**: Suggestions for further exploration and development.
